## What is This Codebase?

A modern Rust client for [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault) targeting
Rust `1.93+`.

## Build System

All the standard Cargo commands apply but with one important detail: make sure to add `--all-features` so that
all feature-gated code (vendor TLV parsing, axum integration) is included.

 * `cargo build --all-features` to build
 * `cargo nextest run --all-features` to run tests
 * `cargo clippy --all-features` to lint
 * `cargo fmt` to reformat
 * `cargo publish` to publish the crate

Always run `cargo check --all-features` before making changes to verify the codebase compiles cleanly.
If compilation fails, investigate and fix compilation errors before proceeding with any modifications.


## Key Files

TBD

## Test Suite Layout

TBD

Use `cargo nextest run --profile default --all-features '--' --exact [test module name]` to run
all tests in a specific module.

### Property-based Tests

Property-based tests are written using [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/) and
use a naming convention: they begin with `prop_`.

To run the property-based tests specifically, use `cargo nextest run --all-features 'prop_'`.

## Source of Domain Knowledge

The [Vault HTTP API guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs).

## Writing Style

Keep comments short and to the point. Avoid filler words like "This function does X" when the
function name already says it. Don't add doc comments to obvious methods. Match the existing
comment density — the codebase is deliberately light on comments.

## Change Log

If asked to perform change log updates, consult and modify `CHANGELOG.md` and stick to its
existing writing style.

## Git Commits

 * Do not commit changes automatically without an explicit permission to do so
 * Never add yourself as a git commit coauthor
 * Never mention yourself in commit messages in any way (no "Generated by", no AI tool links, etc)
